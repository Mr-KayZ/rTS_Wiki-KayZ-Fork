{% include toc.md %}

This document is to make you aware of common forms of scams and what precautions you should take before trusting another individual with personal details or accounts.

This document is to provided you with details on the methods people use to take advantage of the unknowing and what they use to get people to trust them. This document will go into some of the forms people use to gain the "trust" of people, and if you already have fell victim to their scam, it will also discuss what you can do to hopefully recuperate your compromised information and accounts.

## The Tech-Support scam

{: .warning .warning-icon }
> Beware of direct messages from "admins" or "tech-support" for platforms like Discord or Steam, typically offering to fix account issues. These are scams designed to extract sensitive data or jeopardize your account. Genuine services seldom send such messages and official communication, even from Discord staff, doesn't occur on Discord but through a proper ticket system via emails. Any "official" support offered on Discord is fraudulent.

It’s not uncommon to encounter instances where individuals posing as “administrators” or “technical support” representatives for various online services, such as Discord, Steam, and others, will initiate a direct message (DM) conversation with you. The subject of these messages can vary widely, but a common example might be the “resolution of an account issue," such as the common "I accidentally mass reported your account!" scam.

These unsolicited messages may appear legitimate at first glance, with the sender often mimicking the language and tone of a genuine support representative. However, it’s important to note that these messages are, in fact, a form of scam. The individuals behind them are not associated with the service they claim to represent, and their ultimate goal is to deceive you into divulging sensitive information or performing actions that compromise your account’s security.

One common tactic these scammers employ is to ask you to “verify” your account or “sign in” to resolve the supposed issue. This is a massive red flag. Legitimate services will never ask you to provide your login credentials in a direct message. Another scam to be aware of involves password reset requests. Scammers may claim to "verify yourself" with a code, which often is the password reset code or link, with the aim of hijacking your account. Another particularly insidious method involves the use of QR codes. The scammer may ask you to sign in using a QR code, which can lead to your account being compromised. This is a major concern and should be avoided at all costs.

{: .info .info-icon }
> Always remember that **legitimate services typically have established channels for addressing account issues** and rarely, if ever, initiate unsolicited direct messages for such matters. If you receive such a message, it’s best to ignore it and report it to the appropriate authorities within the platform. Stay vigilant and protect your digital presence. Remember, your account security is paramount, and you should never feel pressured into taking actions that could potentially compromise it.

### Example of a Tech-Support scam

The scammer approaches a user claiming they "accidentally" reported them because they themselves were "scammed" by a scammer who "claimed" to be you. This garners sympathy from the potential victim, lowering their guard. Often to further sell the scam, they will show "proof" of reporting "your account" by making a fake account to your likeness:

They then lead you to their "tech support" agent that they were working with to help "resolve" the situation:

The "support" agent may look legitimate, but remember that no official support agent for a service will be utilizing discord to resolve issues, even official discord staff.

## Request from a Compromised Friend’s account seeking assistance

{: .warning .warning-icon }
> Exercise caution when dealing with messages from anyone, even those you consider friends, that request you to "register" or "log in" to assist them with a certain task. Be wary as well of requests to download items to aid in "testing" a game or application, particularly if the sender is not known for engaging in development work. This caution should extend to downloading files such as PDFs, PNGs, or any other type of file under the pretext of checking if it "appears correct", as they can contain viruses. Remember, it's always better to be safe than sorry when it comes to your digital security.

Scams can sometimes appear to originate from individuals within your personal network or acquaintances (such as friends on different platforms). However, it’s crucial to be aware that the person contacting you may not be your friend but rather a scammer who has gained access to your friend’s account. 

They may approach you with a seemingly innocuous request, such as participating in a competition to enhance their probability of success. The sign-in process for such activities may offer multiple methods, including email, Steam, Discord, and others. Upon registration, your account may be compromised due to the unauthorized acquisition of your credentials.

Another variant of this scam involves requests to download and “test” a program, or to review an image or PDF to verify its appearance/contents. The request to test a program should immediately raise suspicions, particularly if the individual in question has not previously engaged in any recognizable development activities. Developers typically exhibit signs of programming knowledge and often share their projects.

As for images or PDFs, they can sometimes conceal malicious code that executes upon opening. Receiving an unsolicited PDF for review should also be viewed with suspicion.

It’s crucial not to place unwarranted trust in friends when it comes to such requests. Always seek additional information regarding the file in question and attempt to verify their identity through alternative communication channels, such as WhatsApp, Discord, or Steam, if possible.

### Example of a compromized account scam

Regrettably, I fell victim to such a scam, in which this particular example will detail.

Amidst a gaming session, I received a personal message on Steam from a friend. They requested my assistance in boosting their team’s standing in a competition by signing in with my Steam account. Distracted by the game, I didn’t scrutinize the chat or probe further. Unwittingly, I signed in using the QR code sign in method Steam offers, overlooking the fact that it originated from a location outside my usual area of residence.

The following day, while I was occupied at work, the scammer gained access to my Steam account. Without my knowledge, they began sending messages to my friends, encouraging them to participate in their “competition” to aid my alleged “team’s victory”.

The following screenshots detail one such interaction of the scammers with one of my friends.

![comp_friend_steam_02.JPG](/assets/tech-scams/comp_friend_steam_02.JPG)

Unaware of the unfolding situation, I continued with my professional responsibilities at my job. Miraculously, another friend from Steam reached out to me on Discord, a platform I predominantly use for communication, as I rarely resorted to Steam chats. They initiated a casual conversation, oblivious to the fact that I was engaged at work. The subsequent screenshot captures our interaction and my abrupt realization that my Steam account had been compromised.

![comp_friend_steam_discord.JPG](/assets/tech-scams/comp_friend_discord.JPG)

Upon this revelation, I promptly reviewed all my friends’ chats, alerting them about the breach in my account’s security. I cautioned them against clicking any links and advised those who had already done so to immediately change their passwords to prevent their accounts from being compromised

![comp_friend_steam_03.JPG](/assets/tech-scams/comp_friend_steam_03.JPG)

Ultimately, I was able to regain control of my accounts, terminate all other Steam sessions, and prevent the scammer from further accessing my friends list, out of sheer luck. However, it’s important to acknowledge that this incident was the result of several oversights on my part. Specifically, I failed to:
- Recognize the site I was directed to and the counterfeit Steam login page on the website.
- Heed the sign-in warning indicating that I was logging in from a device located outside my usual area of residence.
- Request a follow-up or pay closer attention to the messages I sent or logins from other devices.

{: .info .info-icon }
> It’s also noteworthy that the friend whom the scammer attempted to defraud is widely knowledgeable about cybersecurity and familiar with scams of this nature. Yet, they unsuspectingly accepted the scammer’s claims because they came from a trusted friend (i.e., me). This serves as a reminder that even professionals can fall prey to such scams, underscoring the need for heightened vigilance.
